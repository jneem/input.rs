//! # Libinput bindings for rust
//!
//! These bindings closely follow libinput's concepts and it's original API.
//! Please refer to the [libinput documentation](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/)
//! to understand the general structure and concepts.
//!
//! ## Differences to the C-Library:
//!
//! - Refcounting does not need to be done manually. Just call `clone` when you need an additional reference.
//! - Libinput logging cannot (currently) not be customized.
//!
//! ## Userdata handling
//!
//! Multiple types in the libinput library allow to attach a pointer of an arbitrary type, so called `userdata`.
//! Using this data is unsafe as there is no way to find out what type is stored in the libinput struct.
//! Additionally multiple references to the same libinput object may exist and userdata may be shared mutably.
//!
//! This is why using and setting userdata is an unsafe operation (except when creating an object).
//!
//! If you heavily rely on userdata, you should always stored them wrapped in a `Mutex` and use the same
//! type for every userdata access to further simplify usage.
//!
//! You need to be especially cautious when initializing libinput types from raw pointers, you obtained
//! from other libraries which may set their own userdata. If accessing their userdata make sure no shared
//! mutable access may happen and don't store something else instead, if the library does not explicitly
//! allow this.
//!
//! Generally usage of this api is error-prone and discouraged if not needed.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! To get started check out the [`Libinput` struct](./struct.Libinput.html).
